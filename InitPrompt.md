Create a basic Flutter desktop application structure for creating children's books and comics. The application should include:

1.  **A rich text editor** for writing book content (consider using a package like flutter_quill).
2.  **A canvas area** for drawing and illustrating (consider using Flutter's CustomPaint or a drawing board package).
3.  **Integration with Google Gemini API** for:
    - Generating writing prompts and assisting with story writing.
    - Generating images based on user descriptions.
4.  **A modular design** that allows for future integration with Ollama for local AI model support.
5.  **Basic layout functionality** to arrange text and illustrations on pages or comic panels.
6.  **Functionality to connect with Google Drive** for saving and syncing project files.

Start with the basic setup for a Flutter desktop app and include placeholders or basic implementations for the features mentioned above. Focus on a clear project structure and how different components might interact
